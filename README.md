# QuantumClassical-GEFYRA (QC-GEFYRA): Materials Modeling and Electronic Calculations Based on Classical Simulations and Experimental Data

In Greek gefyra means bridge. The main usage of this program is to use atomic configurations obtained from classical simulations results (or experimental data) to calculate  quantum mechnical (electronic) properties via tight-binding formulation. In a sense, the program 'bridges' the classical and quantum world. 

### Installing
To download 
```
git clone https://github.com/phanakata/tight-binding.git
cd tight-binding
```
Try to run an example
```
cd examples/
```
README.md contains descriptions for each example. 
It is recommended to first try using the code for calculating DOS of a flat graphene. 
```
cd graphene_from_experimental_or_MD_data
``` 
The Python notebook contains example how to use the package and explanations about the input parameters. 

This package is still under developement. More features will be added soon.
